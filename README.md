"We pick up where Dropbox dropped off"

## Inspiration
As people who use Google Docs/Dropbox Paper for almost everything from writing college essays to class notes to spontaneous poetry, we’ve found it restrictive in its ability to enhance a user’s experience. We've decided to reimagine popular word processors and integrate them with AI beyond just grammar checks and sentence suggestions.

## What it does
AI Docs is an all-in-one file system that allows you to organize your files and edit them. Its high-level features include an AI-powered search bar for easy access to files and a background AI agent that reads your files to generate workflows and to-do actions for you immediately. For the actual word processor, we're reimagining what it means to write and create. Instead of having a single document and a sidebar for static comments, we extended it to a single document for writing the raw notes, and a dynamic sidebar that allows you to organize your comments/content and prompt AI (and see its responses), having all your notes in one place. This reimagines word processors and sees how AI can truly supplement all forms of writing and creation.
